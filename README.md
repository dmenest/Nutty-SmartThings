# Nutty-SmartThings

## Because I have moved off of SmartThings and switched to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) I cannot verify any code changes so I am no longer accepting pull requests.  I know that [Tim Grimley](https://github.com/mwav3) has been doing some work on updating and improving the device handlers.
